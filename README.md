IDK, I was just doing a Kafka course and wanted to integrate it with Micronaut, gRPC and Postgress.
It's good if you want to saturate your hard drive but also a nice one template for gRPC projects with Kafka (or, in this
case RedPanda).

## How 2
If you want to run it, either export STEAM_API_KEY with a valid Steam api key or edit the settings file, then run the
docker compose then run the application.

## TODO
Separate the producer and consumer logic, but since java frameworks are not good for monorepos probs not gonna happen.
CHEERS!
